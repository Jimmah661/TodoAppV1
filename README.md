Basic Todo page

Techologies used:

Libraries used:
None

Purpose of project:
I was starting to feel rusty regarding my basic HTML and Javascript abilities so I decided to start from scratch and create a Todo app

What this project does:
Communicates with a Firestore database to create Todo's and keep them marked as either finished or unfinished. A listener will dynamically update the Todo's based on changes to the firestore database

How to use:
Enter your Todo in the input field and click the "Save Todo" button to save it in the database.
Click the listed Todo's to set them as either Complete or Incomplete
